- What happened to the IsUnsolvable::islands() routine?  1) It doesn't look like it's used in any
  code, but 2) it *does* look like it's finished (see t/islands.t)
    
    - It's POSSIBLE it takes a large amount of time to compute, but I don't see any information
      anywhere that this was actually tested.

        - If it does take a very long time, there's caching that can be done to speed it up!
          BUT we won't know until we try   ("premature optimization is the root of all evil")

    > Oh, boards/special_difficulties.txt mentions that it fails for two specific boards.

        - TODO: Confirm this still fails here.  If so, fix that bug.

    - Add some tests to islands.t, to confirm the actual shape of each island

        - Also, to make sure that noclipping() is being called on the correct set of pieces


    - Good boards to test this on:          Difficult-12    Difficult-8     Tricky-4        Difficult-15
                Tricky-9



- (maybe)  implement the new features that the author added to the game:

    - Division  (see the "Dividing is Fun" series)

    - Target locations      (see the "10 is Here" and "10 is There" series)
