- What happened to the IsUnsolvable::islands() routine?  1) It doesn't look like it's used in any
  code, but 2) it *does* look like it's finished (see t/islands.t)

    - It's POSSIBLE it takes a large amount of time to compute, but I don't see any information
      anywhere that this was actually tested.

    - If it does take a very long time, there's caching that can be done to speed it up!
      BUT we won't know until we try   ("premature optimization is the root of all evil")

    > Oh, boards/special_difficulties.txt mentions that it fails for these two specific boards.

        - TODO: Confirm this still fails here.  If so, fix that bug.

        - Find a way to dump the island data, to visualize it.

    - Good boards to test this on:          Difficult-8     Tricky-4
