This is a solver for iojoe's game ["10"](http://www.iojoe.com/10/)

Current status: Simpler boards can be solved, but more complex boards take 15+ minutes to solve.  Work is ongoing to speed things up.

It's suspected that this problem is exponentially difficult, because it's similar to:
* [multiple subset-sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#Subset-sum_problem)
* [multiple knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#Multiple_knapsack_problem)
