This is a solver for iojoe's game ["10"](http://www.iojoe.com/10/)

Current status: Simpler boards can be solved, but more complex boards take 15+ minutes to solve.  Work is ongoing to speed things up.

It is known that this problem is [exponentially difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem#Complexity), so it may be unavoidable for this solver to take an extremely long time when there's a large number of pieces.
