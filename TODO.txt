- Add several boards, starting with some *extremely* simple boards, and progressing to
    slightly harder boards.  Try to hit the sweet spot of being as complex as possible, that the
    current solver can still solve.  (which isn't very complex at all, but at least it's more
    complex than the very first trial)


- implement A* or similar

        - while it takes a lot of RAM, we can't do alpha-beta pruning,
            since this is a single-player game

    "A* search is one of the best general-purpose graph search algorithms when there's a way to
    estimate the distance to the goal"
