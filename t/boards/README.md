These are very simple test cases.  They focus in on a very specific feature.

Usually the board is solvable, but can't be solved if the particular feature isn't working.

They're intended to be manually run, because I haven't yet figured out a way to do manual-testing on
them.  While it's easy to run them, it isn't easy for a script to determine if the output is correct
or not.
